## Overview

PyLogicKingst provides a Pythonic interface to the Kingst LA1010 Logic Analyzer hardware using the libsigrok framework. This project simplifies digital signal analysis, protocol decoding, and data visualization in Python by building upon the open-source Sigrok project with dedicated LA1010 support.

## Features

- **Pythonic API**: User-friendly, object-oriented design for working with the LA1010.
- **Protocol Analysis**: Decode common protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, etc.) through libsigrok's decoders.
- **Hardware Integration**: Direct access to LA1010 hardware for signal capture and analysis.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plot waveforms, timelines, and signal statistics.
- **Advanced Data Analysis**: Tools to filter, search, and manipulate captured data.
- **Extendable**: Ability to add custom protocol analyzers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Build tools:
  - CMake 3.15 or higher
  - C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
  - pkg-config (for libsigrok dependencies)
- libsigrok dependencies:
  - libglib2.0-dev
  - libusb-1.0-0-dev
  - libzip-dev
- Kingst LA1010 Logic Analyzer hardware

### Building from Source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maro7tigre/PyLogicKingst.git
   cd PyLogicKingst
   ```

2. Clone sigrok with LA1010 support:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexUg/sigrok.git external/sigrok-kingst
   git clone https://github.com/AlexUg/libsigrok.git external/libsigrok
   ```

3. Extract required firmware:
   ```bash
   python external/sigrok-kingst/fwextractor.py --kingst-dir "/path/to/KingstVIS/installation"
   ```

4. Build and install libsigrok with LA1010 support:
   ```bash
   cd external/libsigrok
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   cd ../..
   ```

5. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Build the Python bindings:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -A x64
   cmake --build . --config Release
   cd ..
   ```

7. Install the Python package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Quick Start

```python
# TODO: later
```
